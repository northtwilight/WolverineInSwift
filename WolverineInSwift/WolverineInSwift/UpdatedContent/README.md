# Wolverine in Swift

<strong>NOTE: Wolverine in Swift is NOT WORKING yet, but I hope to change that state very soon. Just doing this for my own learning and enlightenment.</strong>

Based on the original Python implementation by [BioBootloader], Wolverine in Swift is designed as a tool to iteratively improve Swift source code by running it through GPT-4 and acting on its recommendations. Its original author [BioBootloader] describes it as a way to give your (Python) scripts 'regenerative healing abilities!'. 

You can see his original code here: [https://github.com/biobootloader/wolverine]  

All thanks to [BioBootloader] again for a brilliant PoC and idea!
